I am a second year master's candidate persuing UChicago's MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy. I hail from Mumbai, India and my professional interests include Civic Tech, building data capacity for governments and ethical use of AI. I am a classical music afficianado and indulge in playing story-driven cinematic video games to unwind.
