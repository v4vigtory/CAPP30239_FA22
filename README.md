# Data Visualization for Policy Analysis | CAPP 30239 Course Portfolio | Fall 2022

## About

This is the root repository for all visualizations and assets created during the Fall 2022 quarter studying UChicago's CAPP 30239 course on "Data Visualization for Policy Analysis" designed and taught by Prof. Tiffany France. At the time of creating this repository, I have no experience in HTML, JavaScript and D3 - but over the next few weeks I aim to use these three technologies to create captivating visualizations.

## Course Goals

The course aims to provide students an introduction to data visualization design, theory, and practices, as well as hands-on experience with data visualization tools (primarily D3.js). The projects within this repository aim to employ aspects of visual design principles, storytelling with data, and data ethics into both static and interactive visualizations.
